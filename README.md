# ModernMVVM

This is an example project of a modern iOS app with the MVVM architecture pattern, Combine and SwiftUI frameworks. It follows unidirectional data flow and shows how to represent the UI as a reactive finite-state machine.

The project accompanies [my article on the subject](The https://www.vadimbulavin.com/modern-mvvm-ios-app-architecture-with-combine-and-swiftui/).
