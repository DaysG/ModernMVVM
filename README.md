# ModernMVVM

A sample project demonstrating a modern iOS app with the MVVM architecture pattern, Combine and SwiftUI frameworks. The app follows unidirectional data flow and shows how to represent the UI as a reactive finite-state machine using [CombineFeedback](https://github.com/sergdort/CombineFeedback).
